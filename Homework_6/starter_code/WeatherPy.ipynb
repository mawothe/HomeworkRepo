    "* As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude). More interestingly, however, is the fact that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt of the earth.\n",
    "* There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. However, it is interesting to see that a strong band of cities sits at 0, 80, and 100% cloudiness.\n",
